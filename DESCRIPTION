Description: This package can be used to generate and plot Voronoi treemaps or
    sunburst treemaps from hierarchical data. There are different implementations for
    Voronoi tesselations in R, the simplest being the deldir() function (from package
    deldir). However, deldir and other do not handle nested Voronoi tesselations, nor
    do they perform additively weighted Voronoi tesselation. This is an important
    demand for systems biology and other applications where one likes to scale the cell
    size (or area) to a set of predefined weights. The functions provided in this package
    allow both the additively weighted Voronoi tesselation, and the nesting of different
    hierarchical levels in one plot. The underlying functions for the tesselation
    were developed and published by Paul Murrell, University of Auckland, and serve
    as the basis for this package. They are called by a recursive wrapper function,
    voronoiTreemap(), which subdivides the plot area in polygonal cells according to
    the highest hierarchical level.  It then continues with the tesselation on the next 
    lower level uisng the child cell of the previous level as the new parental plotting
    cell, and so on. The sunburst treemap is a computationally less demanding treemap that
    does not require iterative refinement, but simply generates circle sectors that are
    sized according to predefined weights. It is also a arecursive algorithm and can be
    used to draw sectors of different hierarchical level with increasing granularity.
